          Research Internship at Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA
          sponsored by the Office of Naval Research <i>[Jun 16, 2014 - Aug 12, 2014]</i>

          Produced a research paper titled, Domain Sensitive Textual Sentiment
          Analysis, based on a novel technique for natural language processing.
          The technique enabled automatic association of semantically related
          information from disparate content sources, which is otherwise very
          hard to mine. Developed a prototype Java program to read and associate
          information sets scattered across a variety of databases and content
          sources. The research contribution significantly helps in breaking the
          communication barriers between disjoint groups of military personnel
          who are cleared at different security levels, without compromising
          their individual secrets.
